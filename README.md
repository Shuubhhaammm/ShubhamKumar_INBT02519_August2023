Description: This Repository contains the source code of the three tasks tha are provided during the duration of internship assigned by iNeuBytes. In these three tasks, two are the micro project (i.e. Task-1 & Task-2) and one major Task (Task-3).

Task_1 (Micro Task) : To create Landing page on any product.
     In this HTML and CSS project, I crafted a dynamic product landing page designed to captivate and inform potential
     customers about a featured product. Employing modern design principles, I structured the content using HTML and styled 
     it with CSS to ensure a visually engaging and responsive layout across various devices. The landing page prominently 
     showcased the product's attributes through high-quality images, succinct descriptions, and strategically placed call-to-
     action buttons. Social proof and testimonials were integrated to build trust, while a user-friendly contact section 
     provided avenues for inquiries. Throughout development, I maintained clean and efficient code, adhering to semantic 
     HTML and optimizing for browser compatibility. The result is a seamless user experience that effectively communicates 
     the product's value and drives user interaction, underscoring my proficiency in creating compelling web interfaces 
     using HTML and CSS.  

Task_2 (Micro Task) : To develop a Joke generator website.     
     In this project, I conceived and executed a dynamic Joke Generator website using a blend of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and 
     API integration. The website's primary objective was to deliver a playful and user-engaging experience by fetching 
     jokes from an external API and seamlessly displaying them on the webpage.
     The project began with crafting the HTML structure to ensure a coherent layout, followed by CSS styling that 
     harmoniously combined typography, colors, and responsive design principles. The focal point, JavaScript, played a 
     pivotal role in orchestrating the user experience. By manipulating the DOM, I created a seamless joke-refreshing 
     mechanism without necessitating full page reloads. 
     API integration formed the core functionality, where JavaScript facilitated asynchronous requests to the API, 
     extracting joke data from the JSON responses. User interaction was optimized, allowing them to select joke categories 
     and initiate real-time fetching of jokes with just a click.
     Through meticulous coding and error handling, I ensured a smooth user journey even when dealing with potential API 
     request failures or category selection issues. This project underscores my adeptness in unifying various web 
     technologies to produce a user-centric, amusing, and seamlessly functional Joke Generator website.
     
Task_3 (Major Task) : To create clone of Netflix Website.
     In this project, I meticulously developed a Netflix Clone website, replicating the design and functionality of the 
     popular streaming platform. By harnessing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I aimed to create an immersive user experience 
     that closely resembled the original while showcasing my proficiency in web development.
     The project's foundation involved meticulously structuring the HTML to mirror Netflix's layout, ensuring an intuitive 
     and familiar user interface. I then applied CSS styling to recreate the platform's visual aesthetics, paying close 
     attention to typography, color schemes, and responsive design to guarantee optimal viewing across devices.
     JavaScript played a pivotal role in enhancing interactivity. I implemented features like image carousels for displaying 
     movie previews, interactive buttons for navigation, and modals for showing additional information about movies and TV 
     shows. User experience was paramount, with smooth transitions and seamless functionality.
